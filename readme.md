# Web Speech Color Game

A coding exercise from Wes Bos's beginner javascript course.

The app works with Chrome's speech recognition API. The user says a color name from the list on the page. If the color is valid, the app will play an animation and change the background with that color.

**Note:** The app only works on Chrome. And you need to run a local server.
